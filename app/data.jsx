It’s simple—engagement reflects how much your audience cares about your content. A smaller, engaged audience brings more value (and ROI) than a massive but silent following. Platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn prioritize engaging content, boosting its organic reach. Engaged users are more likely to interact with your brand, trust your messages, and become loyal customers. This is where working with a skilled digital marketing company in Bhopal becomes crucial—they can help you understand what drives engagement for your specific audience."
